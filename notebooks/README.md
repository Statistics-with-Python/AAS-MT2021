# Jupyter notebooks

These notebooks are for use in the course Applied Analytic Statistics. Each of
the directories, `example-<n>` contains two notesbooks:
`example-<n>-questions.ipynb` and `example-<n>-answers.ipynb`. The *questions*
notebook contains the questions for the practical sessions and the *answers* one
has partial answers. Please give the questions a solid attempt before looking at
the answers. For some examples there is a `example-<n>-data.ipynb` which
contains code to simulate data for those examples which make use of simulated
data.

In addition to the [course text
book](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-3E/index.html)
the I recommend the book, [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) for
those relatively new to programming. Any feedback you have regarding these
notebooks is very welcome. If you encounter technical problems with them, please
lodge an issue
[here](https://github.com/aezarebski/aas-extended-examples/issues).
