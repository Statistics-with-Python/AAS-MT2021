# Jupyter notebooks

The notebooks in this repository are being written for use in the course Applied
Analytic Statistics. Each of the directories, `example-<n>` contains two
notesbooks: `example-<n>-questions.ipynb` and `example-<n>-answers.ipynb`. The
*questions* notebook contains the questions for the practical sessions and the
*answers* one has partial answers. Please give the questions a solid attempt
before looking at the answers. For some examples there is a
`example-<n>-data.ipynb` which contains code to simulate data for those examples
which make use of simulated data.

In addition to the [course text
book](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Applied-Regression-3E/index.html)
the I recommend the book, [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) for
those relatively new to programming. For an overview of the packages we will be
using in this course see [this notebook](file:./example-0/welcome.ipynb).
